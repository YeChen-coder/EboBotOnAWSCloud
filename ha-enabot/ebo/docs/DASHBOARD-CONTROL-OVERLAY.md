# EBO — "app-like" view: video with overlaid controls

Reproduces the app's full-screen screen: the **camera stream** with a **D-pad** on top to move the
robot, plus laser, return to base, "talk", speed and status.

## Prerequisites (Home Assistant side)
1. **Add-on started** with `video: true` (and, if you want audio, `audio: true` / `talk: true`).
2. **A camera entity** pointing at the add-on's RTSP stream. The best way is **go2rtc**
   (included in HA OS) so you also get **audio** and low latency:
   - In `configuration.yaml` (or in the go2rtc config) add the stream:
     ```yaml
     go2rtc:
       streams:
         ebo: rtsp://<IP-ADD-ON>:8554/ebo
     ```
     and create the generic camera that uses it, **or** use the WebRTC card (`custom:webrtc-camera`)
     with `url: ebo`.
   - Quick alternative (video only, no audio): **Settings → Devices → Add
     integration → Generic Camera**, Stream URL = `rtsp://<IP-ADD-ON>:8554/ebo`.
   Name the resulting entity, e.g., `camera.ebo`. **Replace `camera.ebo`** below with yours.
3. Turn on the **EBO camera** switch (or `mqtt.publish` to `ebo/camera/set` = `on`): only then
   does the bridge subscribe to the robot's video.

## Card A — `picture-elements` (native, no extra component)
Paste as a new card (YAML mode). The arrows move the robot with a soft "step" that stops on its own
(`hold`), like a repeatable tap. **Replace `camera.ebo`** and the status `entity` values
with the real IDs (find them in Settings → Devices → "EBO Air 2").

### Notes
- The D-pad uses `ebo/move/vector` with `hold`: each tap moves a little and **stops on its own**.
  Want longer/shorter steps? Change `hold` (seconds) or the `ly`/`rx` values (−100..100).
- **Safety:** these commands *move* the robot. Use them only with the robot in a safe area and
  under your supervision (never remotely if you don't know what's around it).
- Also want to **talk** from the video? Add an `mdi:microphone` icon that opens an `input_text`
  with the audio URL and publishes to `ebo/talk` (requires `talk: true`).

## Card B — analog joystick (faithful to the app, drag)
Requires a custom card. If you want it I'll write it for you: a JS file (Lovelace resource) that draws
a **draggable joystick** on top of the video and publishes continuously to `ebo/move/vector`
(release → stop), exactly like the app's analog pad. Just say "make card B".
